        <strong>Game Summary:</strong><br>
        PUBG is the game that started the battle royale craze. Up to 100 players parachute onto a massive island,
        scavenge
        for weapons and gear, and fight until only one person or team remains alive. Every match is unique ‚Äî you choose
        where to land, how to loot, and how to survive.

        Inspired by ARMA mods created by Brendan ‚ÄúPlayerUnknown‚Äù Greene, PUBG turned the concept into a full, polished
        experience. Its combination of realistic gunplay, tense survival moments, and open-world tactics made it a

        Survive within a shrinking safe zone ‚Äî anyone caught outside takes damage until they die.

        Fight solo, duo, or in squad mode (up to 4 players).

        Use vehicles like jeeps, bikes, and boats for quick escapes or ambushes.

        The weapons system is deep, featuring scopes, attachments, recoil patterns, and realistic ballistics. Success
        depends on positioning, awareness, and teamwork more than just aim.

        <strong>Game Summary:</strong><br>
        God of War is a legendary action-adventure series that follows Kratos, a fierce Spartan warrior haunted by his
        past. In the early games, Kratos embarks on a blood-soaked journey through Greek mythology, battling gods,
        titans, and mythical beasts in his quest for vengeance against the Olympians who betrayed him.

        The 2018 reboot transformed the series into a deeply emotional story set in Norse mythology. Now older and more
        mature, Kratos seeks redemption while raising his son Atreus. The game explores themes of fatherhood, destiny,
        and control, offering a perfect balance between brutal combat and heartfelt storytelling.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Gameplay and Features:</strong><br>
        God of War combines intense, skill-based combat with deep exploration and puzzle-solving. The combat system
        evolved from chaotic hack-and-slash in the older games to strategic, cinematic, and immersive third-person
        combat in the newer ones. Players can use the Leviathan Axe, Blades of Chaos, and a wide variety of runic
        attacks to take down gods, trolls, and mythical beasts.

        The 2018 reboot introduced a single-shot camera system, meaning the entire game unfolds without a single camera
        cut ‚Äî creating a movie-like experience. Players can explore open regions, solve environmental puzzles, upgrade
        gear, and bond with Atreus, who assists in combat and story moments. Every encounter feels meaningful, with
        perfectly balanced difficulty and spectacle.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Graphics and Realism:</strong><br>
        God of War is known for breathtaking visuals and cinematic detail. The 2018 and 2022 games use motion capture,
        realistic lighting, and dynamic weather to create one of the most beautiful and immersive worlds in gaming. From
        the snowy peaks of Midgard to the fiery depths of Muspelheim, every realm feels alive and handcrafted.

        The attention to character animations, voice acting, and music (composed by Bear McCreary) adds emotional weight
        to every scene. On PS5, God of War: Ragnar√∂k runs at high frame rates and 4K resolution, making it one of the
        most visually stunning games ever released.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sales and Popularity:</strong><br>
        God of War is one of PlayStation‚Äôs flagship franchises, with over 70 million copies sold across all its titles.
        The 2018 reboot sold more than 23 million copies, earning critical acclaim and winning Game of the Year (2018).
        Its sequel, Ragnar√∂k, became the fastest-selling first-party PlayStation game, selling 5.1 million copies in its
        first week.

        The series is beloved for its combination of raw action, emotional storytelling, and mythological depth. Kratos
        has become a gaming icon, symbolizing power, struggle, and evolution. With its success in both sales and
        storytelling, God of War stands among the greatest video game franchises of all time, influencing countless
        other action games and setting a new bar for narrative-driven gameplay.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Legacy and Impact:</strong><br>
        God of War changed the way story-driven action games are made. It redefined how games can blend deep emotional
        storytelling with brutal, satisfying gameplay. Kratos evolved from a symbol of rage into one of the most complex
        characters in video game history ‚Äî a father, warrior, and god struggling to do better.

        The reboot influenced countless modern games like Elden Ring, Horizon, and Ghost of Tsushima, pushing the
        industry toward more mature, cinematic storytelling. Its use of mythology, one-take camera design, and
        character-driven narrative set new standards for game development.

        perfect blend of emotion, power, and artistry. It‚Äôs more than a game; it‚Äôs a myth reborn.

        monsters, and gods. Created by Hidetaka Miyazaki (creator of Dark Souls) in collaboration with George R.R.
        Martin (author of Game of Thrones), the game blends rich storytelling, brutal combat, and a mysterious, haunting
        world.

        Players take on the role of the Tarnished, an exiled warrior who returns to restore order by becoming the Elden
        Lord. The world is vast, interconnected, and full of secrets ‚Äî from eerie catacombs to massive castles and
        mystical landscapes. The game‚Äôs lore is deep and hidden within item descriptions, dialogues, and visual
        storytelling, encouraging exploration and discovery.

        <strong>Gameplay and Features:</strong><br>
        lden Ring combines the intense combat system of Dark Souls with a massive open-world design. Players can freely
        explore vast lands on horseback, fight deadly bosses, and craft weapons and items. The game offers multiple
        playstyles ‚Äî melee, magic, stealth, or hybrid ‚Äî allowing every player to shape their journey uniquely.

        The open-world structure is revolutionary for FromSoftware games. You can choose where to go, when to fight, or
        whether to skip challenges entirely. The world feels alive, dangerous, and mysterious, with dynamic weather and
        day-night cycles enhancing immersion.

        Multiplayer features allow summoning allies for co-op battles or invading other players‚Äô worlds, keeping the
        community alive and competitive.
